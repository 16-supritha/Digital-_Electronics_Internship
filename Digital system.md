## What is Digital Electronics?

**Digital Electronics** is a field of electronics involving digital signals that use binary values (0 and 1) to represent information. It forms the basis of all modern computing devices, utilizing logic gates and circuits to perform operations.

Unlike analog electronics, where signals vary continuously, digital systems work with discrete voltage levels which makes them less susceptible to noise and easier to process.
